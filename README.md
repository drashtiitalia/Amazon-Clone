A fully functional E-commerce website


This is a clone of the well-known e-commerce website Amazon. Customers can browse products and make purchases. It offers a sign in/sign up feature that keeps track of the user's cart and purchases. It was built with React on the frontend, Node and Express on the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and Razorpay for payment integration.
